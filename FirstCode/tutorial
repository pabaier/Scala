sbt commands
    help - gets a list of commands

          - use ~ for continuous compile/run (runs on save)
    settings - see the settings for the project
      
build.sbt - defines certain settings and dependencies
    (%% allows you to remove the version from 'scalatest' 
     -it will use the version defined)

    compile - compiles the main scala code
    run - runs Hello.scala
    test - runs SetSuite.scala
    reload - need to run when build.sbt is updated
    console - brings up Scala console
        val pb = new User("paul", "pb@b.com") - will create an object from User class
        pb.name
